## Is it safe to use in production?
From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace">Wikipedia</a>:
>Special consideration has been taken to make DTrace safe to use in a production environment. For example, there is minimal probe effect when tracing is underway, and no performance impact associated with any disabled probe; this is important since there are tens of thousands of DTrace probes that can be enabled. New probes can also be created dynamically.
