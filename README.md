## The Tailor-Made Sandbox for Your Application
`secimport` is production-oriented sandbox toolkit.<br>
It traces your code, and runs an executable that allows only the same syscalls per module.

- ðŸš€ Trace which syscalls are called by each module in your code.
  - secimport uses USDT (Userland Statically Defined Tracing) probes in the runtime using eBPF or dtrace instrumentation scripts.
- ðŸš€ Control the execution or third-party and open-source packages you can't fully control.
  - Avoid incidents like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell">log4shell</a>.
- ðŸš€ Prevent code execution, reduce the risk of supply chain attacks.
  - Trace the syscalls flow of your application at the user-space/os/kernel level and per module.
  - Run your application while enforcing syscalls per module.
  - Upon violation of the policy, it can log, stop, or kill the process.
- ðŸš€ Has negligible performance impact and is production-ready thanks to eBPF. Check out the [Performance](https://github.com/avilum/secimport/wiki/Performance-Benchmarks) benchmarks.

## Installation
Tested on Ubuntu, Debian, Rocky (Linux x86/AMD/ARM) and MacOS in (x86/M1).<br>

### With Docker
For quicker evaluation, we recommend using the <a href="#Docker">Docker</a> image instead of self-installing.<br>
- Build and run the Docker container with a custom kernel that matches your existing OS kernel version:
  ```
  cd docker/ && ./build.sh && ./run.sh
  ```
  A temporary container will be created, and you will be logged in as the root user.

### Without Docker
1. Install python with USDT probes by <a href="https://github.com/avilum/secimport/wiki/Installation#python-interpreter-requirements">configuring it with '--dtrace'</a>
2. Install one of the backends: <a href="https://github.com/avilum/secimport/wiki/Installation">eBPF or DTrace</a>.
3. Install secimport
  - Install from pypi
    - ```
      python3 -m pip install secimport
      ```
  - Install from source
    - ```
      git clone https://github.com/avilum/secimport.git && cd secimport
      python3 -m pip install poetry && python3 -m poetry install
      ```


## Usage
To sandbox your program using the CLI, start a bpftrace program that logs all the syscalls for all the modules in your application into a file with the secimport trace command. Once you have covered the logic you would like to sandbox, hit CTRL+C or CTRL+D, or wait for the program to finish. Then, build a sandbox from the trace using the secimport build command, and run the sandbox with the secimport run command.

```shell
NAME
    SecImport - A toolkit for Tracing and Securing Python Runtime using USDT probes and eBPF/DTrace

SYNOPSIS
    cli.py COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
    QUICK START:
            >>> secimport interactive

    EXAMPLES:
        1. trace:
            $  secimport trace
            $  secimport trace -h
            $  secimport trace_pid 123
            $  secimport trace_pid -h
        2. build:
            $ secimport build
            $ secimport build -h
        3. run:
            $  secimport run
            $  secimport run --entrypoint my_custom_main.py
            $  secimport run --entrypoint my_custom_main.py --stop_on_violation=true
            $  secimport run --entrypoint my_custom_main.py --kill_on_violation=true
            $  secimport run --sandbox_executable /path/to/my_sandbox.bt --pid 2884
            $  secimport run --sandbox_executable /path/to/my_sandbox.bt --sandbox_logfile my_log.log
            $  secimport run -h

COMMANDS
    COMMAND is one of the following:

     build

     interactive

     run
       Run a python process inside the sandbox.

     trace
       Traces

     trace_pid
       Traces a running process by pid. It might require sudo privilleges on some hosts.

```

## Stop on violation 
```

 >>> secimport run

 >>> secimport run

## Dynamic profiling - trace, build sandbox, run.
```shell
root@1fa3d6f09989:/workspace# secimport interactive

Let's create our first tailor-made sandbox with secimport!
- A python shell will be opened
- The behavior will be recorded.

OK? (y): y
 >>> secimport trace

TRACING: ['/workspace/secimport/profiles/trace.bt', '-c', '/workspace/Python-3.10.0/python', '-o', 'trace.log']

                        Press CTRL+D to stop the trace;

>>> import this

```

Now, let's run the sandbox.
```python
- Run the same commands as before, they should run without any problem;.
- Do something new in the shell; e.g:   >>> __import__("os").system("ps")

        OK? (y): y
 >>> secimport run

For more detailed usage instructions, see the [Command-Line Usage](https://github.com/avilum/secimport/wiki/Command-Line-Usage) page.

## Python API

You can also use `secimport` by replacing `import` with `secimport.secure_import` for selected modules. See the [Python Imports](examples/python_imports/) example for more details.

## Docker
The quickest way to evaluate `secimport` is to use our [Docker container](docker/README.md), which includes `bpftrace` (`ebpf`) and other plug-and-play examples.
