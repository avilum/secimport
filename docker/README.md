# Try secimport with bpftrace

## How to Use

1. Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker
2. `./build.sh`
    - will build a docker image with
        - python with dtrace static USDT instrumentations
        - bpftrace
        - secimport code
    - ~1GB in size
3. `./run.sh` will start a new docker container with secimport.
    - `secimport-shell` or `./trace.sh` will open a syscall-tracing python shell.
        - All syscalls and modules will be logged to traced_modules.json once you hit CTRL+D.
    - `./run_sandbox.sh` will run a python script inside the sandbox `sandbox.bt`.
      -   It will execute `os.system('ps')`, and the process will be killed.
        - Logs will be written to `sandbox.log`
    - You can use `-v` in docker run to mount your code into the container and trace it.

```python
root@d57458518cbf:/workspace$ ./run_sandbox.sh
ðŸš€ Starting secimport sandbox with bpftrace backend, the sandbox should kill the python process...
WARNING: Addrspace is not set
  PID TTY          TIME CMD

   10 pts/0    00:00:00 bash

   27 pts/0    00:00:00 ps


ðŸ›‘ The process was killed, as expected.
ðŸš€ The sandbox bpftrace code is at sandbox.bt
ðŸš€ The sandbox log is at sandbox.log.
```

## FAQ

### How it runs on macOS?
- The Docker for mac runs Linux on a hypervisor called hyperkit, and docker runs inside it, so you can use Linux features.

### Can we trace a macOS host with this docker?
- Not at the moment. The bpftrace runs inside a Linux VM.
- For macOS, there is dtrace.
